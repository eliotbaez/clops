# CLOPS

CLOPS stands for Complex Linearly-Organized Point System.

CLOPS is a game played with a tennis ball, and 2-3 players plus 1
referee. Different scoring events are triggered by different plays, of
which there are too many to list here. Each player's score is stored as
a complex number, and each scoring event applies some operation to one
or both of the players' scores, such as incrementation, subtraction,
rotation, scaling, or combinations of these.
